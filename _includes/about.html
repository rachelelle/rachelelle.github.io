                    <p>Hello! My name is Rachel and I'm currently a junior studying Media Studies and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I enjoy creative storytelling through words and visual design and building communities - online and offline - through event planning and web development. I'm a user experience designer and developer who loves meeting at the intersection of media, design, and technology.</p>
