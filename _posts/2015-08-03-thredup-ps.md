description: I spent my summer as a Product Manager Intern at thredUP building a new and improved version of Personal Shops, a personalization tool that will enable users to quickly find relevant items to purchase based on the searches they save (whether they are free searches or filters). <a href="http://thredup.com">thredUP</a> is an online fashion resale shop (available for web and on Android and iOS). First, I dug through our data to identify trends for our saved searches. For user research, I conducted a survey and followed up with phone interviews to identify users' shopping behaviors patterns and main objectives for using Personal Shops. After compiling user research, I used a mental model that would guide our design decisions, the KPIs set, and the rest of the product cycle to achieve goals according to the user's thought process. We tested internally and invited users for user testing sessions to test our first iteration of the prototype. Taking their feedback, I iterated for a second version and established milestones for completing the product features. View the prototype of the second iteration <a href="http://share.framerjs.com/daab0qd1fmzh/">here</a>. Only the last three elements in Recently Searched are active in the prototype. A more detailed Behance project describing my process is in the works!
