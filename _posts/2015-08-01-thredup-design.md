description: I set up the web framework for designers and engineers to easily access thredUP's brand guidelines. The Product team noticed that at times there weren't clear understandings between designers and engineers of what the brand guidelines were. Since the brand guidelines for iOS, Android, and web still have yet to be finalized in the midst of the Shop Overhaul process, the content isn't filled for most of the pages.
