description: TrashScan is an interactive device that uses object-recognition and machine learning to sort waste into the correct bins while educating students about sustainability! For our final project for Critical Practices, we interviewed staff at Cal Recycling, a part of the greater sustainability community on the UC Berkeley campus, to design a solution for the problems of cross-contamination in bins and students' apathy toward learning to throw away trash correctly. Learn more about the process of designing the final prototype on our <a href="https://www.hackster.io/trashscan/trashscan-3ca9fe">Hackster page</a>. It has been featured as a <a href="http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/student-project/trashscan/">Project Spotlight</a> at the Jacobs Institute of Design at UC Berkeley.
