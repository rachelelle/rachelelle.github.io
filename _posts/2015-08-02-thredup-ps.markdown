<section>
    Last summer, I had the honor of interning at <a href="http://thredup.com">ThredUP</a>, the world's largest online fashion resale shop, with the Product team. My role combined Product Management and Product Design. My main project for the summer was redesigning Personal Shops, a personalization feature that saves product filters.
</section>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 project-problem">
  		<h2 class="block-title">Problem</h2>
  		  Only a very small percentage of users onboarded to the feature, yet its users have the highest average order values.
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 project-role">
  	<h2 class="block-title">Role</h2>
  		My role was conducting user research, prototyping, and conducting user testing. I worked with multiple teams, such as Product, Engineering, Design, and Marketing, in the process of developing specs and receiving feedback.

<h1 class="section-title">Data Mining</h1>

I first pulled current data on users with Personal Shops to find the top trends uses of filters and looked at which platforms (web, mobile/web, iOS, and Android) were the most popular.

<section>
<h1 class="section-title">User Research</h1>
I surveyed users with over 10 Personal Shops to understand their behaviors for saving so many shops in the first place. I followed up with 7 users who consented to following up with me for a more in-depth discussion about their use of thredUP and other shopping apps.
<br>
<br>
Based on my conversations with the users, I created a mental model to understand the user's train of thought.
<ul>
  <strong>Mental Model:</strong>
    <li>Can I quickly find relevant items?</li>
    <li>How can I find great deals that caters to my family's lifestyle?</li>
    <li>How can I easily shop my favorite brands?</li>
    <li>Will these items fit me?</li>
    <li>Will it save me search time?</li>
    <li>How can we get coveted items first?</li>
</ul>
<br>
We also further refined the idea of creating a Style Profile for every account in order to set Sizes and top 10 brands.

	<h1 class="section-title">Prototype v 1.0</h1>
	View the first iteration <a href="http://share.framerjs.com/y2r6k8czd5k7/">here</a>.
  <br>
  After my first user test, I gained a lot of helpful insights for improving the next iteration.
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
  <strong>Findings:</strong>
    <li>Simplify the view - remove color coding</li>
    <li>The concept of "Pocket" was too confusing.</li>
    <li>Users wanted to be able to click through a feed row to see the PLP.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h1 class="section-title">Prototype v 2.0</h1>
  Since I had limited time to conduct another user test, I tested internally. See my second iteration <a href="http://share.framerjs.com/daab0qd1fmzh/">here</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
  <strong>Findings:</strong>
    <li>Web first, mobile will follow.</li>
    <li>There are mixed feelings about the heart iconography</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h1 class="section-title">Takeaways</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Involve other stakeholders earlier in the process to learn about potential contraints.</li>
	<li>Simplicity and elegance rules. Think about information hierachy when considering the visual. Only emphasize what needs to be emphasized. </li>
	<li>Don't be afraid to go deeper into understanding users' behaviors by constantly asking "why" questions during user testing.</li>
</ul>
