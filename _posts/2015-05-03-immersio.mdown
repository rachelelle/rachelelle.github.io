<section>
    Our team of four worked with Immersio, a VR/AR design company, in Spring 2015 to redesign an immersive virtual reality experience for art museum exhibitions. You can view more details on our <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/28274269/BI-x-Immersio-Virtual-Museum" target="_blank">Behance</a>.

  		<h2 class="block-title">Problem</h2>
  		  Our client came to us with an open-ended proposal to redesign the experience of his existing virtual art gallery.

        <li>Facilitated brainstorming sessions</li>
        <li>Conducted interviews for user research</li>

<h1 class="section-title">User Research</h1>
We visited art galleries in Downtown San Francisco and interviewed gallery owners and visitors to understand their motivations for purchasing art (if they happened to be buyers) and their thoughts of interacting with art virtually. 
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<strong>Findings:</strong>
  <li>We faced concern and resistance from art gallery owners and art buyers.</li>
  <li>It didn’t make sense for them to experience art virtually; they must see art in person before they consider purchasing.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
Based on our findings, we decided to pivot from the original prompt to designing an educational, virtual reality experience at museums.  We identified our target users as art historians, students, and museum attendees.

<h1 class="section-title">Challenges</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Findings from user research can pivot the original design and inform clients about the feasibility of their ideas.</li>
  <li>It was difficult to prototype for a 3D interface on tools that are used to design 2D interfaces.</li>
	<li>Designing for an unfamiliar interface such as virtual reality can be challenging with lack of design documentation, but there is more freedom to think outside of the box.</li>
</ul>
