description: For our semester-long project with <a href="http://www.innovation.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Innovation</a>, my group members and I worked with <a href="http://www.immers.io/">Immersio</a> to design a new user experience for its virtual art gallery. After interviewing art gallery owners and conducting user research about purchasing and observing art in a virtual experience, we concluded that viewing art in a virtual reality space should be done in a museum as a supplement for educating museum visitors and archiving past exhibits to introduce virtual reality to the masses. To make the museum visitors experience as immersive as possible and give the user more control of the space, we had panels of different exhibits surrounding the user (in the center of the circle of panels) as they were standing in a museum lobby.
