  As a part-time, remote Product Intern at thredUP for the last six months, I redesigned and implemented the <a href="{{ page.external_url }}" target="_blank">ThredUP Support Page</a>. The new Zendesk website allows thredUP’s two kinds of users, Shoppers and Sellers, to easily find answers to their questions.
</section>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 project-problem">
      <h2 class="block-title">Problem</h2>
      Customers would directly email the Customer Support team to ask simple questions that had already been answered on Zendesk. This would add unnecessary inefficiencies to their workflow.
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 project-role">
    <h2 class="block-title">Role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In collaboration with the Customer Support team, I organized the sections and articles they wanted to display to users</li>
        <li>Created additional iconography</li>
        <li>Mocked up a prototype in Marvel</li>
        <li>Implemented the frontend in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery</li>
    </ul>

<h1 class="section-title">Design Process</h1>
<p>
Depending on the user’s role (whether they were a Shopper or a Seller), I wanted them to be able to quickly and easily find their question among the many categories. A first path to finding the question would be to toggle between the two categories of “Shopping” and “Selling” at the top, then locate the appropriate category.  The second entry point would be a left side sliding, accordion style menu bar, that would nest further into the category clicked. I included both solutions in my sketch.

  <h1 class="section-title">Iconography</h1>
  I added icons to clearly signify the different section categories under “Shopping” and “Selling.” These were based on icons that can also be found on <a href="http://thredup.com">thredUP</a>.

  <h1 class="section-title">Prototyping</h1>
  Based on the sketch I drew during the design process, I created a prototype in Marvel. I shared this prototype with the Design and Customer Support teams to receive feedback before I proceeded to code the changes in Zendesk.

  <h1 class="section-title">Final Product</h1>
  I coded the website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. The new website format of <strong>toggling between categories</strong> based on the two different user roles (Selling and Shopping) has proven to be a easier way for users to find answers to their questions. The addition of <strong>iconography</strong> to sections titles allows users to easily identify which section their question belongs to. As a result, Customer Support team has been experiencing <strong>less direct emails since launch</strong>. A second iteration with the left sliding sidebar will be released soon.
