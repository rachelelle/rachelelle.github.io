summary: <a href="http://tripit.com" target="_blank">TripIt from Concur</a> organizes your flight, hotel, and car rental plans into a master trip itinerary. I’ve been reimagining Alternate Flights for native iOS and Android, a pro feature that helps users search and rebook flights. We're minimizing travel anxieties by getting business and leisure travelers to their destination on time.

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
The existing Alternate Flights on mobile pulls up a web view with a seemingly broken experience due to lack of system status feedback of loading flight results. The search navigation for flights is difficult to edit and the users find the flight results unscannable. It fails to provide travelers actionable steps to rebook a flight.
