	<a href="http://tripit.com" target="_blank">TripIt from SAP Concur</a> imports flight, hotel, and restaurant email confirmations to organize a master trip itinerary. It is a trusted travel companion that provides flight alerts and assists users with getting to plans. I redesigned Alternate Flights for iOS and Android, a Pro feature that enables users to search and rebook alternate flights. We're minimizing travel anxieties by getting business and leisure travelers to their destination on time.
