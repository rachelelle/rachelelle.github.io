summary: <a href="http://tripit.com" target="_blank">TripIt from SAP Concur</a> organizes your flight, hotel, and car rental plans into a master trip itinerary. I redesigned Alternate Flights, a pro feature that enables users to search and rebook alternate flights. We're minimizing travel anxieties by getting business and leisure travelers to their destination on time.
