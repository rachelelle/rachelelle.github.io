<a href="http://modern-citizen.com">Modern Citizen</a> is the online style destination for the modern woman. The problem I sought to address as a web development intern was creating features and pages for content creation and creative brand content. My mental model throughout the design process was "how can I make customers clearly understand our brand vision and engage with what it means to be a modern woman?" I coded Modern Citizen's blog layout and other website features for engagement with social media.
<h1 class="section-title">Blog</h1>
We wanted to further engage our customers with content related to the brand identity of forward thinking women going places in their careers and in travel. Currently, the blog is unavailable on the website.
