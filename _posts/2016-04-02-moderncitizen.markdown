<p class="intro"><a href="http://modern-citizen.com">Modern Citizen</a> is the online style destination for the modern woman. The problem I sought to address as a web development intern was creating features and pages for content creation and creative brand content. My mental model throughout the design process was "how can I make customers clearly understand our brand vision and engage with what it means to be a modern woman?" I coded Modern Citizen's blog layout and other website features for engagement with social media.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Blog</h1>
We wanted to further engage our customers with content related to the mission of forward-thinking women going places in their careers and in travel. It is structured by 3 square images for feature stories and 3 columns for each blog post. Currently, the blog is unavailable on the website.
