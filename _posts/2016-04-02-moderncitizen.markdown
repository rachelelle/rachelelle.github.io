<a href="http://modern-citizen.com">Modern Citizen</a> is the online style destination for the modern woman. The problem I sought to address as a web development intern was creating features and pages for content creation and creative brand content. My mental model throughout the design process was "how can I make customers clearly understand our brand vision and engage with what it means to be a modern woman?" I coded Modern Citizen's blog layout and other website features for engagement with social media.
