description: I redesigned ThredUP's FAQ Support website to create a clearer flow for buyers and sellers. The problem prior to the redesign was that the overwhelming number of questions (not organized under categories) prompted users to directly email Customer Support for simple questions already answered in Zendesk. The changes to the Support page are now live, but there are still additional changes that need to be added to match the high-fidelity <a href="https://marvelapp.com/8aijdh">prototype</a>.
