<p class="intro"><a href="http://modern-citizen.com">Modern Citizen</a> is the online style destination for the modern woman. The problem I sought to address as a web development intern was creating features and pages for content creation and creative brand content. My mental model throughout the design process was "how can I make customers clearly understand our brand vision and engage with what it means to be a modern woman?" I coded Modern Citizen's blog layout and other website features for engagement with social media.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">The Blog</h1>
We wanted to further engage our customers with content related to the mission of forward-thinking women going places in their careers and in travel. It is structured by 3 square images for feature stories and 3 columns for each blog post. Currently, the <a href="http://www.modern-citizen.com/blogs/thecompass" target="_blank">blog</a> is unavailable on the website.

<h1 class="section-title">VIP Program</h1>
I designed and coded a call to action on the website for customers to join Modern Citizen's VIP Program to receive exclusive access to upcoming collections and receive samples curated by stylists. This program is currently unavailable online.
