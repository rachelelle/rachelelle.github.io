  Our team of four developed an Android mobile and smartwatch application for <a href="http://http://teaching.paulos.net/cs160_SP2016/">CS 160: User Interface Design</a> with a focus on building healthcare apps. We created SmartBrush, a dental hygiene app that motivates teens and young adults to develop proper dental hygiene habits through social competition.

      <h2 class="block-title">Problem</h2>
      Children who learn poor brushing and flossing techniques from their parents often carry these habits into their adulthood. Neglecting dental hygiene can lead to unwanted cavaties and gum diseases down the road, which can hurt self-confidence in one's appearance.

      I designed visual assets, animations, and the overall UX Design. I also participated in interviewing users. I implemented GifViews in Android.
